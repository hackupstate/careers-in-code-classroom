<!-- # Class Structure (Move to lesson plan for orientation)

    - Lesson (25 mins)
    - Break (10 mins)

## Punctuality
We expect all participating instructors to arrive on time to class except for in cases of emergency.

## Before Class
### Prep Work
Instructors are expected to create prep work for each class for the students to complete beforehand.

## During Class
Instructors should be actively engaging students in lesson plans.

## After Class
### Debrief Survey Review
Students will actively contribute to the daily debriefs. We expect instructors to listen to students at the end of class, review them, and *possibly* adapt their lessons accordingly.

### Weekly Feedback Survey Submission
We expect that instructors will complete a short survey after they have completed their week of teaching.

## Ongoing Feedback
Instructors are vital to the success of our program. We hope that you will shape and refine our curriculum to ultimately align students with professional software developer positions
